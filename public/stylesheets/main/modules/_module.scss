// Module Module
//
// Modules are components that include both a definition of how they appear and how they behave.
// These include components like, accordions, dropdowns, and popups.
//
// The biggest distiction between a Module and an Element is that Modules requires javascript to function
// whereas an element can be styled on its own with no javascript.
